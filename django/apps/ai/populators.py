on the start date.\r\n- Some fields require dates or durations. For those fields, return the dates in "3-letter-month year" format. If it\'s a duration, "start date - end date" with the previous stated format.\r\n- Ensure clarity and consistency in formatting throughout.',

Format it in *title case*.\n   - *Contextual Similarity Criteria: Ensure the **contextual similarity* to existing skill titles is *greater than 75%*.\n\n4. *Validation of New Skills*:\n   - *Only add skills* to *new_skills* if they meet the following conditions:\n     1. *Contextual similarity > 75%*.\n     2. *Skill names must be in English*.\n     3. *Avoid duplicate meanings*, even with different names.\n     4. *Exclude soft skills* unless *context (e.g., job title)* justifies their inclusion.\n     5. *Filter by relevance*â€”new skills must align with the user\'s domain, field, or industry based on context.\n\n### Output Format\n\nProvide a JSON object with:\n- *matched_skills: An array listing matched skills, each with *title* and *pk**.\n- *new_skills: An array of **new skills* formatted in *title case*.\n\n### Example Input:\n\njson\n{\n  "raw_skills": ["JavaScript", "Banking", "Communication", "Leadership"],\n  "resume_data": {\n    "work_experiences": [\n      {\n        "job_title": "Front-End Developer",\n        "company_name": "Tech Solutions",\n        "employment_dates": "Jan 2022 - Present",\n        "key_responsibilities": [\n          "Developed web applications using JavaScript frameworks."\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    "education": [\n      {\n        "degree": "BSc in Computer Science",\n        "institution": "University of Toronto",\n        "graduation_date": "Jun 2021"\n      }\n    ],\n    "languages": ["English", "French"]\n  },\n  "other_data": {\n    "interests": ["Programming", "Web Development"]\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Example Output:\n\njson\n{\n  "matched_skills": [\n    {\n      "pk": 132,\n      "title": "In-depth knowledge of specific banking products (e.g., mortgages, personal loans, business loans)"\n    }\n  ],\n  "new_skills": [\n    {\n      "title": "Javascript Programming Language"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n### Notes:\n\n- *Focus on raw_skills: Allocate **75%* of the focus to matching them.\n- *Prioritize Technical and Domain-Specific Skills: Pay **less attention to soft skills* unless explicitly supported by contextual data.\n- *Use Context: Improve matches using data from *resume_data* and *other_data**.\n- *Strict Matching Limit: Ensure **one match per skill* in *raw_skills*.\n- *Contextual Matching: Use **contextual and semantic understanding*, not direct string matching.\n- *Meaning-Based Filtering*:\n  - Match skills *based on their purpose and use cases* (e.g., *JavaScript* relates to *software development*).\n  - Avoid matches unrelated to context.\n  - Skills with insufficient contextual evidence should be *ignored*.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. *Skill Comparison*:\n   - Compare each skill in *raw_skills* to existing database skills.\n   - Use *context* from *resume_data* and *other_data* for *relevance improvement*.\n\n2. *Match and Update*:\n   - Include matches with a *70% similarity score* or higher.\n   - For new skills, validate based on:\n     - *Contextual similarity > 75%*.\n     - *Exclusion of generic soft skills* unless contextually supported.\n\n3. *Output Formatting*:\n   - Return a JSON object formatted like the *Example Output*.\n   - Include *at most one match* per skill in *matched_skills*.\n\n### Key Updates:\n\n1. *Enhanced Contextual Evaluation*:\n   - Matches consider *semantic and contextual meaning, ensuring relevance to **domains or industries*.\n   - Example: *"JavaScript"* maps to *programming roles*, not unrelated fields.\n\n2. *Soft Skills Deprioritized*:\n   - Evaluate *soft skills only if justified by context* (e.g., job titles, work experience).\n   - *Exclude generic soft skills* if no contextual support exists.\n\n3. *Validation and Meaning Check*:\n   - New skills must pass *contextual similarity > 75%*.\n   - Avoid duplicates based on *semantic meaning*, not just names.\n\n4. *Strict English Language Requirement*:\n   - All skills must be in *English*â€”exclude non-English names.\n\n### Final Note:\n\nThe JSON object containing the *existing database skills* is appended at the end of the prompt after the following tokens:  \n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS THE DATA:\n\n',
