                instruction='Match job titles from a user-provided resume JSON object to available job records in a file store. Use contextual information in the resume to enhance accuracy when identifying similar job opportunities.\r\n\r\nEnsure the job-matching process follows this rule:\r\n\r\n- **Input Structure**:\r\n  - The input is a JSON object with multiple keys:\r\n    - `"resume_data"`: Contains the user’s resume information, such as job titles, work experiences, education, and other relevant details. \r\n    - Other keys: Additional details like gender, city, country, or interests may provide context but have equal contribution to the focus.\r\n\r\n- **Job Matching Process**:\r\n  - **Extract Job Titles**:\r\n    - Parse `"resume_data"` to identify all job titles, leveraging contextual fields (e.g., `"work_experiences"`) for better understanding.\r\n  - **Cross-reference with Job Records**:\r\n    - Match extracted job titles to available job records based on a semantic or contextual similarity score of 65% or higher.\r\n    - Use the job record file `js-jobs-store.json`, which includes job objects in the format:\r\n      ```json\r\n      { "pk": <primary key>, "title": <job title> }\r\n      ```\r\n  - **Consider Contextual Information**:\r\n    - Use fields such as `"city"`, `"country"`, or `"education"` to prioritize matches that align with the user’s location, industry, or qualifications.\r\n\r\n- **Output Format**:\r\n  - Provide a JSON list with all matching job entries. Each entry should include:\r\n    - `"pk"`: The primary key of the matched job.\r\n    - `"title"`: The title of the matched job.\r\n  - If no matches are found, return an empty array.\r\n\r\n- **Example Input**:\r\n  ```json\r\n  {\r\n    "resume_data": {\r\n      "work_experiences": [\r\n        {\r\n          "job_title": "Software Engineer",\r\n          "company_name": "TechCorp",\r\n          "employment_dates": "Jan 2019 - Present"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          "job_title": "Junior Developer",\r\n          "company_name": "CodeBase Inc.",\r\n          "employment_dates": "Jun 2016 - Dec 2018"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      "education": [\r\n        {\r\n          "degree": "BSc in Computer Science",\r\n          "institution": "University of Example",\r\n          "graduation_date": "May 2016"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      "city": "Toronto",\r\n      "country": "Canada"\r\n    },\r\n    "gender": "Female",\r\n    "interests": ["Coding", "Data Science"]\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- **Example Output**:\r\n  ```json\r\n  [\r\n    { "pk": 12, "title": "Software Engineer" },\r\n    { "pk": 34, "title": "Junior Developer" }\r\n  ]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- **Primary Focus on `"resume_data"`**: Prioritize the `"resume_data"` field, particularly on extracting job titles and their context.\r\n- **Semantic Similarity**: Match job titles with at least 65% similarity to those job titles in `js-jobs-store.json`.\r\n- **Location and Qualification Context**: Use location (`"city"`/`"country"`) and education fields to refine job matches further.\r\n- **Error Handling**:\r\n  - If `"resume_data"` is missing, prompt the user to provide their resume JSON.\r\n  - Provide clear error messages for invalid or incomplete inputs.\r\n- **Only output JSON as markdown within ```json``` tags.\r\n\r\n# Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Job Titles**:\r\n   - Parse the `"resume_data"` field to identify job titles.\r\n   - Use additional fields (e.g., `"work_experiences"`, `"education"`) for better accuracy.\r\n\r\n2. **Cross-reference Job Records**:\r\n   - Match extracted titles against the job records in `js-jobs-store.json`.\r\n   - Consider contextual fields to prioritize location-appropriate and industry-relevant matches.\r\n\r\n3. **Output Results**:\r\n   - Return a JSON list of matched job records.\r\n   - Ensure that unmatched titles do not appear in the output.\r\n   - Ensure on return only list mentioned in **Example Output**\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n- **The JSON containing the data from the existing database is appended at the end of the prompt after the following tokens: "\\nTHE FOLLOWING IS THE DATA:\\n"',
