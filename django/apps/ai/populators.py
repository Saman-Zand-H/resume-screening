Format it in **title case**.\n   - **Contextual Similarity Criteria**: Ensure the **contextual similarity** to existing skill titles is **greater than 82%**.\n\n4. **Validation of New Skills**:\n   - **Only add skills** to **`new_skills`** if they meet the following conditions:\n     1. **Contextual similarity > 82%**.\n     2. **Skill names must be in English**.\n     3. **Avoid duplicate meanings**, even with different names.\n     4. **Exclude soft skills** unless **context (e.g., job title)** justifies their inclusion.\n     5. **Filter by relevance**\u2014new skills must align with the user\'s domain, field, or industry based on context.\n\n### Output Format\n\nProvide a JSON object with:\n- **`matched_skills`**: An array listing matched skills, each with **`title`** and **`pk`**.\n- **`new_skills`**: An array of **new skills** formatted in **title case**.\n\n### Example Input:\n\n```json\n{\n  "raw_skills": ["JavaScript", "Banking", "Communication", "Leadership"],\n  "resume_data": {\n    "work_experiences": [\n      {\n        "job_title": "Front-End Developer",\n        "company_name": "Tech Solutions",\n        "employment_dates": "Jan 2022 - Present",\n        "key_responsibilities": [\n          "Developed web applications using JavaScript frameworks."\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    "education": [\n      {\n        "degree": "BSc in Computer Science",\n        "institution": "University of Toronto",\n        "graduation_date": "Jun 2021"\n      }\n    ],\n    "languages": ["English", "French"]\n  },\n  "other_data": {\n    "interests": ["Programming", "Web Development"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  "matched_skills": [\n    {\n      "pk": 132,\n      "title": "In-depth knowledge of specific banking products (e.g., mortgages, personal loans, business loans)"\n    }\n  ],\n  "new_skills": [\n    {\n      "title": "Javascript Programming Language"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Focus on `raw_skills`**: Allocate **75%** of the focus to matching them.\n- **Prioritize Technical and Domain-Specific Skills**: Pay **less attention to soft skills** unless explicitly supported by contextual data.\n- **Use Context**: Improve matches using data from **`resume_data`** and **`other_data`**.\n- **Strict Matching Limit**: Ensure **one match per skill** in **`raw_skills`**.\n- **Contextual Matching**: Use **contextual and semantic understanding**, not direct string matching.\n- **Meaning-Based Filtering**:\n  - Match skills **based on their purpose and use cases** (e.g., **JavaScript** relates to **software development**).\n  - Avoid matches unrelated to context.\n  - Skills with insufficient contextual evidence should be **ignored**.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Skill Comparison**:\n   - Compare each skill in **`raw_skills`** to existing database skills.\n   - Use **context** from **`resume_data`** and **`other_data`** for **relevance improvement**.\n\n2. **Match and Update**:\n   - Include matches with a **78% similarity score** or higher.\n   - For new skills, validate based on:\n     - **Contextual similarity > 82%**.\n     - **Exclusion of generic soft skills** unless contextually supported.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**:\n   - Return a JSON object formatted like the **Example Output**.\n   - Include **at most one match** per skill in **`matched_skills`**.\n\n### Key Updates:\n\n1. **Enhanced Contextual Evaluation**:\n   - Matches consider **semantic and contextual meaning**, ensuring relevance to **domains or industries**.\n   - Example: **"JavaScript"** maps to **programming roles**, not unrelated fields.\n\n2. **Soft Skills Deprioritized**:\n   - Evaluate **soft skills only if justified by context** (e.g., job titles, work experience).\n   - **Exclude generic soft skills** if no contextual support exists.\n\n3. **Validation and Meaning Check**:\n   - New skills must pass **contextual similarity > 82%**.\n   - Avoid duplicates based on **semantic meaning**, not just names.\n\n4. **Strict English Language Requirement**:\n   - All skills must be in **English**\u2014exclude non-English names.\n\n### Final Note:\n\nThe JSON object containing the **existing database skills** is appended at the end of the prompt after the following tokens:  \n```\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS THE DATA:\n\n\n```',
