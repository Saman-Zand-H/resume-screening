Summary and Core Competencies sections to be broadly applicable across various job sectors.\r\n- Focus on transferable skills and quantifiable achievements, especially in the Work Experience section.\r\n- Sort arrays with objects including chronological data, date strings with "Present" as their end date are considered prior to others, and make sure the next criteria for sorting is based on the start date.\r\n- Some fields require dates or durations. For those fields, return the dates in "3-letter-month year" format. If it\'s a duration, "start date - end date" with the previous stated format.\r\n- Ensure clarity and consistency in formatting throughout.',

Format it in *title case*.\n   - *Contextual Similarity Criteria: Ensure the **contextual similarity* to existing skill titles is *greater than 75%*.\n\n4. *Validation of New Skills*:\n   - *Only add skills* to *new_skills* if they meet the following conditions:\n     1. *Contextual similarity > 75%*.\n     2. *Skill names must be in English*.\n     3. *Avoid duplicate meanings*, even with different names.\n     4. *Exclude soft skills* unless *context (e.g., job title)* justifies their inclusion.\n     5. *Filter by relevance*—new skills must align with the user\'s domain, field, or industry based on context.\n\n### Output Format\n\nProvide a JSON object with:\n- *matched_skills: An array listing matched skills, each with *title* and *pk**.\n- *new_skills: An array of **new skills* formatted in *title case*.\n\n### Example Input:\n\njson\n{\n  "raw_skills": ["JavaScript", "Banking", "Communication", "Leadership"],\n  "resume_data": {\n    "work_experiences": [\n      {\n        "job_title": "Front-End Developer",\n        "company_name": "Tech Solutions",\n        "employment_dates": "Jan 2022 - Present",\n        "key_responsibilities": [\n          "Developed web applications using JavaScript frameworks."\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    "education": [\n      {\n        "degree": "BSc in Computer Science",\n        "institution": "University of Toronto",\n        "graduation_date": "Jun 2021"\n      }\n    ],\n    "languages": ["English", "French"]\n  },\n  "other_data": {\n    "interests": ["Programming", "Web Development"]\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Example Output:\n\njson\n{\n  "matched_skills": [\n    {\n      "pk": 132,\n      "title": "In-depth knowledge of specific banking products (e.g., mortgages, personal loans, business loans)"\n    }\n  ],\n  "new_skills": [\n    {\n      "title": "Javascript Programming Language"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n### Notes:\n\n- *Focus on raw_skills: Allocate **75%* of the focus to matching them.\n- *Prioritize Technical and Domain-Specific Skills: Pay **less attention to soft skills* unless explicitly supported by contextual data.\n- *Use Context: Improve matches using data from *resume_data* and *other_data**.\n- *Strict Matching Limit: Ensure **one match per skill* in *raw_skills*.\n- *Contextual Matching: Use **contextual and semantic understanding*, not direct string matching.\n- *Meaning-Based Filtering*:\n  - Match skills *based on their purpose and use cases* (e.g., *JavaScript* relates to *software development*).\n  - Avoid matches unrelated to context.\n  - Skills with insufficient contextual evidence should be *ignored*.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. *Skill Comparison*:\n   - Compare each skill in *raw_skills* to existing database skills.\n   - Use *context* from *resume_data* and *other_data* for *relevance improvement*.\n\n2. *Match and Update*:\n   - Include matches with a *70% similarity score* or higher.\n   - For new skills, validate based on:\n     - *Contextual similarity > 75%*.\n     - *Exclusion of generic soft skills* unless contextually supported.\n\n3. *Output Formatting*:\n   - Return a JSON object formatted like the *Example Output*.\n   - Include *at most one match* per skill in *matched_skills*.\n\n### Key Updates:\n\n1. *Enhanced Contextual Evaluation*:\n   - Matches consider *semantic and contextual meaning, ensuring relevance to **domains or industries*.\n   - Example: *"JavaScript"* maps to *programming roles*, not unrelated fields.\n\n2. *Soft Skills Deprioritized*:\n   - Evaluate *soft skills only if justified by context* (e.g., job titles, work experience).\n   - *Exclude generic soft skills* if no contextual support exists.\n\n3. *Validation and Meaning Check*:\n   - New skills must pass *contextual similarity > 75%*.\n   - Avoid duplicates based on *semantic meaning*, not just names.\n\n4. *Strict English Language Requirement*:\n   - All skills must be in *English*—exclude non-English names.\n\n### Final Note:\n\nThe JSON object containing the *existing database skills* is appended at the end of the prompt after the following tokens:  \n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS THE DATA:\n\n',
