Additionally, you must **extract contact information** from the CV and include it in the output under a new key named **`contact_informations`**. The contact information should be **formatted correctly** and include only the following types: **WhatsApp**, **LinkedIn**, **Phone Number**, **Website**, and **Address**. Any contact details outside these specified types should be **ignored**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Formatting Guidelines**:\r\n\r\nEnsure the uploaded CV is formatted according to the "Standard Canadian Resume Template for All Jobs", as outlined below. The **contact information** extracted from the document should be incorporated into the relevant section at the top of the resume, and other sections should follow the guidelines below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Contact Information**:\r\n- **Full Name**  \r\n- **Professional Email Address**  \r\n- **City and Province/Territory**  \r\n\r\n#### **Professional Summary**:\r\n- A **brief 2-4 sentence summary** highlighting professional achievements and unique value proposition.\r\n\r\n#### **Core Competencies or Skills**:\r\n- Include both **technical** and **soft skills**.

Each entry should include:\r\n    - `"pk"`: The primary key of the matched job.\r\n    - `"title"`: The title of the matched job.\r\n  - If no matches are found, return an empty array.\r\n\r\n- **Example Input**:\r\n  ```json\r\n  {\r\n    "resume_data": {\r\n      "work_experiences": [\r\n        {\r\n          "job_title": "Software Engineer",\r\n          "company_name": "TechCorp",\r\n          "employment_dates": "Jan 2019 - Present"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          "job_title": "Junior Developer",\r\n          "company_name": "CodeBase Inc.",\r\n          "employment_dates": "Jun 2016 - Dec 2018"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      "education": [\r\n        {\r\n          "degree": "BSc in Computer Science",\r\n          "institution": "University of Example",\r\n          "graduation_date": "May 2016"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      "city": "Toronto",\r\n      "country": "Canada"\r\n    },\r\n    "gender": "Female",\r\n    "interests": ["Coding", "Data Science"]\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- **Example Output**:\r\n  ```json\r\n  [\r\n    { "pk": 12, "title": "Software Engineer" },\r\n    { "pk": 34, "title": "Junior Developer" }\r\n  ]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- **Primary Focus on `"resume_data"`**: Prioritize the `"resume_data"` field, particularly on extracting job titles and their context.\r\n- **Semantic Similarity**: Match job titles with at least 65% similarity to those job titles in `js-jobs-store.json`.\r\n- **Location and Qualification Context**: Use location (`"city"`/`"country"`) and education fields to refine job matches further.\r\n- **Error Handling**:\r\n  - If `"resume_data"` is missing, prompt the user to provide their resume JSON.\r\n  - Provide clear error messages for invalid or incomplete inputs.\r\n- **Only output JSON as markdown within ```json``` tags.\r\n\r\n# Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Extract Job Titles**:\r\n   - Parse the `"resume_data"` field to identify job titles.\r\n   - Use additional fields (e.g., `"work_experiences"`, `"education"`) for better accuracy.\r\n\r\n2. **Cross-reference Job Records**:\r\n   - Match extracted titles against the job records in `js-jobs-store.json`.\r\n   - Consider contextual fields to prioritize location-appropriate and industry-relevant matches.\r\n\r\n3. **Output Results**:\r\n   - Return a JSON list of matched job records.\r\n   - Ensure that unmatched titles do not appear in the output.\r\n   - Ensure on return only list mentioned in **Example Output**\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n- **The JSON containing the data from the existing database is appended at the end of the prompt after the following tokens: "\\nTHE FOLLOWING IS THE DATA:\\n"',
